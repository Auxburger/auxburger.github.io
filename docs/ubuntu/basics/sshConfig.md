# Enhance your SSH experience

In Linux you generally have to mark a file as executable if you desire to run it. 
This works by first setting the executable of the file with

```shell
 sudo chmod +x myexec
```

and second by executing it with

  ```shell
 ./myexec.
 ```

You can for example write your scripts with any text editor, mark it with #!/bin/bash and run it with those commands.
